# Lexical analyzer
CPSC 323 Project 1: Lexical analyzer in Python

### Development
You will need Python 3+ to run this program.

To run the program, type the following command

` 
python3 main.py
 `  
Note that `inputs_scode.txt` must be in same directory as `lexer.py` in order for the program to execute.

After running the program a `output.txt` will be created showing all of the tokens and lexemes provided from `inputs_scode.txt`. 

#### Description

This program is a lexer which converts source text from `inputs_scode.txt` and processes it into a sequence of 
tokens and lexemes in `output.txt`. 

In order to run other test cases modify `inputs_scode.txt` and rerun the program respectively.
